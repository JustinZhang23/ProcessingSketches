## Interactive Sketches & Visualization

### Snake Game
A modern take on the classic arcade game:

- Control a snake that grows each time it eats an apple.
- Avoid running into walls or yourself.
- Game difficulty increases as the snake grows.
- Interactive and responsive, offering a fun, classic gameplay experience.

### Optical Illusion
An interactive optical illusion using squares and parallel lines:

- Click and drag to alter the illusion’s alignment.
- Adjust square colors and spacing with keyboard controls.
- Creates dynamic visual effects demonstrating perception tricks and geometric patterns.

### Forest Horizon
A generative landscape sketch combining night sky and forest elements:

- Click above the horizon to generate clouds or stars.
- Click below the horizon to create trees or flowers.
- Element size scales interactively based on mouse position.
- Moon and horizon are procedurally generated for a serene visual.
- Canvas can be reset or saved using keyboard shortcuts.

### Visualization Tool: Median Household Income & Demographics
An interactive data visualization of U.S. states:

- Dropdown menu to select any U.S. state.
- Bar chart displays median income by race.
